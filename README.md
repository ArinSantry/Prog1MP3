This program is a game of two-player tic tac toe (both players are human). One player will always play 'X' and the other will always play 'O'

The gameboard has the same layout as a number keypad, and the players will enter the number of the space they wish to mark.

Players can play mulitple games and will alternate who goes first. The game will also keep track of each player's wins and the number of ties.
